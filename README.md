# SPYHUB-copy-move-forgery-detection
Detection of copy-move forgery using SIFT and SURF algorithms. (key-point based)

• Surveyed 25 research papers, developed UML diagrams, requirements analysis, and project planning

• Implemented Keypoint based algorithms(SIFT and SURF) and removed outliers using RANSAC

• Created a GUI in python to take user input and give output by highlighting forgeries in input image with average accuracy of
91.2%
